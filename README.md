## Table of Contents
### [P1 - Detecting Lane Lines](./P1%20-%20LaneLines)
Summary: Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection to detect lane lines.
<br> Keywords: Computer Vision
<br>![Detecting Lane Lines Demo](./P1%20-%20LaneLines/test_videos_output/demo.gif)

### [P2 - Advanced Lane Finding](./P2%20-%20AdvancedLaneLines)
Summary: Learnt about the process of Advanced Lane Finding through the course and through the aid of other individuals. Learnt how to build an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, color transforms, and gradient thresholding.
<br> Keywords: Computer Vision, OpenCV
